- [x] Prototype with dummy game
- [ ] Proof of concept (priority) (tic tac toe ? rock paper scissors ?)
- [ ] init agent with arguments (clap) data (where to get argument data ?)
- [ ] design config file for agents (2 parts : tested agent config<u>s</u> for students + "main" config for evaluation (server-side))
- [ ] parse config file (first: main config only)
- [ ] use config to launch agents
- [ ] read about differents tournaments systems
- [ ] implement smarter tournaments systems REVIEW: continuous evaluation ? periodic reset ?
- [ ] Doc: Write somewhere that threads/multiprocess are not possible for agents !
- [ ] Mesure communication delay
- [ ] Using a DB (csv) to avoid running same matches (with same agents) again (using binary hash + conf)
- [ ] Check if agents can overflow their piped IO-Buffers
