- [x] Prototype with dummy game
- [x] Proof of concept (priority) (tic tac toe ? rock paper scissors ?)
- [x] find a better way to configure/deal with restrictions
- [x] add logs to matches
- [x] separate scheduler logic from tournament logic
- [ ] implement bye logic
- [ ] apply restrictions to agents
- [ ] collects scores
- [ ] create lots of agents with strange behavior
- [ ] format final scores
- [ ] design config file for agents (2 parts : tested agent config<u>s</u> for students + "main" config for evaluation (server-side))
- [ ] parse config file (first: main config only)
- [ ] init agent with arguments (clap) data (where to get argument data ?)
- [x] read about differents tournaments systems
- [ ] implement smarter tournaments systems REVIEW: continuous evaluation ? periodic reset ?
- [x] tournament iterator should check constraints
- [ ] Doc: Write somewhere that threads/multiprocess are not possible for agents !
- [ ] Mesure communication delay
- [ ] Using a DB (csv) to avoid running same matches (with same agents) again (using binary hash + conf)
- [ ] Check if agents can overflow their piped IO-Buffers
