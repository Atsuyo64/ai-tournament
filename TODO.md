- [x] Prototype with dummy game
- [x] Proof of concept (priority) (tic tac toe? rock paper scissors?)
- [x] find a better way to configure/deal with restrictions
- [x] add logs to matches
- [x] separate scheduler logic from tournament logic
- [ ] implement bye logic
- [x] apply restrictions to agents
- [x] collect scores
- [x] collect scores nicely
- [ ] create lots of agents with strange behaviour
- [ ] format final scores
- [ ] design config file for agents (2 parts : tested agent config<u>s</u> for students + "main" config for evaluation (server-side))
- [ ] parse config file (first: main config only)
- [ ] init agent with arguments (clap) data (where to get argument data?)
- [x] read about different tournaments systems
- [ ] implement smarter tournaments systems REVIEW: continuous evaluation? periodic reset?
- [x] tournament iterator should check constraints
- [ ] Measure communication delay
- [ ] Using a DB (csv) to avoid running same matches (with same agents) again (using binary hash + conf)
- [x] Check if agents can overflow their piped IO-Buffers
