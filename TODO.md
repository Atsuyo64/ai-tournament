- [x] Prototype with dummy game
- [x] Proof of concept (priority) (tic tac toe? rock paper scissors?)
- [x] find a better way to configure/deal with restrictions
- [x] add logs to matches
- [x] separate scheduler logic from tournament logic
- [x] implement bye logic
- [x] apply restrictions to agents
- [x] collect scores
- [x] collect scores nicely
- [x] create lots of agents with strange behaviour
- [x] format final scores
- [x] design config file for agents (2 parts : tested agent config<u>s</u> for students + "main" config for evaluation (server-side))
- [x] parse config file (first: main config only)
- [x] init agent with arguments (clap) data (where to get argument data?)
- [x] read about different tournaments systems
- [ ] implement smarter tournaments systems REVIEW: continuous evaluation? periodic reset?
- [x] tournament iterator should check constraints
- [x] Measure communication delay
- [ ] Using a DB (csv) to avoid running same matches (with same agents) again (using binary hash + conf)
- [x] Check if agents can overflow their piped IO-Buffers
- [ ] Agent Launcher "trait" => either exe or object
- [x] Update Game trait
- [x] option to disable print
- [ ] option to disable ANSI
- [x] swiss option: 'match-per-confrontation'
- [ ] swiss prevent playing against same adversary
- [ ] swiss prevent double bye
- [x] merging interface and cgroup manager into server ?
- [x] renaming server
- [x] README + entry documentation
- [x] log all matches to a file
- [ ] cli args with clap (or other) => wont do it: this is not a binary but a lib.
- [x] cgroup + taskset fallback
- [ ] test on Windows
